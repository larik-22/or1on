# Defition of Done

The definition of done allowes team members to properly assess the state of tasks. We, as a team, came up with following rules for task to be considered "done":

- The task accomplishes the appropriate issue's description. 
- All coding changes must be documented. 
- The developer must follow the [Git Workflow](git_development_guide.md) when working on the task. 
- Code must contain at least some tests (if possible) to illustrate that the feature or changes are tested and, thus, wouldn't cause any bugs in existing codebase.
